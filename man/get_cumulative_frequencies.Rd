\title{obtain cumulative allele frequency of rare lof and functional variants}
\usage{
get_cumulative_frequencies(vars, threshold = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{dataframe of variants (one row per allele), which includes the
number of times that allele was observed within the population, as
well as the total number of alleles in the population. Alternatively,
this can be a list of dataframe, each for a different population}

\item{threshold}{minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold, we exclude variants
with MAF values above or equal to this threshold. This needs to be
matched to the thresh9old used during identification of the
biallelically inherited genotypes.}
}
\value{
a list of loss of function cumulative frequency, functional
        cumulative frequency and synonymous cumulative frequency.
        Alternatively, if the function was prvoided
        with a list of dataframe, return a list of frequency lists, named as
        per the input list.
